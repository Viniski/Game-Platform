# Game-Platform
An application that allows you to play simple games: Snake, Memory Game and Tic-Tac-Toe for one and two players.

## Description
While learning programming, I have fun and satisfaction in creating simple games that I can run and play in my browser. I created a few such games, including paper scissors or a hanged man or a spaceship. For this reason, I decided to create a game platform where I will place several smaller projects as one larger project. 

The game menu design was inspired by the Stunt GP game menu that I was a fan of during my childhood.

The memory game was one of the first small games I created, it is written in simple procedural javascript. The code could be refactored, but I leave it as it is so that I can read it at any time and see my progress in writing clean code. The game begins by uncovering colored rectangles for two seconds and then matching them in pairs.

In tic-tac-toe we can play two people, I plan to create an AI in order to create a game for one user, where we will compete with the computer.

In snake I used the canvas API to create the graphics for the snake game. Simple 2D graphics show the snake, the playing field and show the current score. The colors refer to the snake played in the past on the indestructible Nokia 3310 xD

Snake and the circle and cross were written using the JavaScript class, so we will notice class fields or this in this code. All games run responsively on devices with different screen resolutions.


Have fun and get the highest scores!
